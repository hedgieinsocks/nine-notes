# ðŸŽµ Nine Notes - Firefox addon

## Create up to nine notes in your sidebar and navigate among them in tab-like fashion.

This addon will help you quickly create and manage a handful of notes without any hustle. You will be able to:

- decide how many notes to keep (1-9);
- rename notes (double middle button click on the tab name);
- choose the font size and the font itself;
- disable soft wrap if need be;
- switch between light/dark theme;
- disable additional buttons;
- save individual notes to Firefox default Download folder;
- send the highlighted text to a chosen note via right-click context menu

The addon is using **local** storage to keep the notes because **sync** storage has too strict limitations: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/storage/sync#storage_quotas_for_sync_data

This being said, this addon is not going to feature sync between devices.
